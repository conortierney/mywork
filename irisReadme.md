# You are expected to be able to break this project into several smaller tasks that
# are easier to solve, and to plug these together after they have been completed. 

# 1.Research the data set online and write a summary about it in your README.
#   2. Download the data set and add it to your repository.
#   3. Write a program called analysis.py that:
#      1. Outputs a summary of each variable to a single text file,
#      2. Saves a histogram of each variable to png files, and
#      3. Outputs a scatter plot of each pair of variables.
#      4. Performs any other analysis you think is appropriate


# explain what investigating a data set entails and how
# Python can be used to do it.
