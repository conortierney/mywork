# make a histogram of salaries

#Write a program that plots a histogram of the salaries (from Question 1)

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

minSalary = 20000
maxSalary = 80000
numberOfEntries = 100

# this is so that the "random" numbers are the same each time to make it easier to debug.
np.random.seed(1)
salaries = np.random.randint(minSalary, maxSalary, numberOfEntries)

plt.hist(salaries)
plt.show()
