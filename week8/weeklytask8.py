# notes on histogram
# density=True argument normalizes the histogram so that the area under the histogram is equal to 1.
#The histogram will have 50 bars, each representing a range of values from the minimum value to the 
#maximum value of the data, divided into 50 equally spaced bins. The height of each bar represents 
#the frequency of values that fall within that bin range. Since the distribution is normal, 
#the histogram will have a bell-shaped curve, with most values concentrated around the mean of 5
