## Programming and Scripting 2023




This repository is used for the problem sets given during the Programming and scripting module on Higher Diploma in Data Analytics course from GMIT.
Here I will explain how I came to the solution of given tasks, reference the sources I researched for solving the problems and list the technologies I used for creating and testing the code.
I have previous knowledge and understanding of basics of coding in python so for some tasks I didn't require extensive research.
