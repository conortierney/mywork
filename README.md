## Pands- Problem- Sheet

### Author: Conor Tierney


This readme file is related to the tasks outlined for the pands problem sheets for Programming and Scripting module in HDip in computing in Data Analytics.

The file here will explain the code, input and output for each task. It will also reference any sources used to solve and test the tasks.

Most of my problem solving for the tasks was gained throught practicing python coding in Andrew Beatty's lectures and weekley labs.
