### Description
This readme file is related to the tasks outlined for the pands problem sheets for Programming and Scripting module in HDip in computing in Data Analytics.

The file here will explain the code, input and output for each task. It will also reference any sources used to solve and test the tasks.

Most of my problem solving for the tasks was gained throught practicing python coding in Andrew Beatty's lectures and weekley labs.

VSCode sofware is used to code the programs.


### Weekly Tasks

## *Hello World!*

Task 1 of the PANDS Problem Sheet was download and istall the software needed for the module. These were cmder (windows), anaconda, vscode, git and notepad++. After the required software was insatlled on my machine I created my github account and two repositories called ''mywork'' and ''pands-problem-sheet".

The pands-problem-sheet contains a python program that displays ***Hello World!*** when it is run. This is task 1.

***code***  
`print ("helloworld!")`

***user output:***  
`helloworld!`

## bank.py

This program is called bank.py. When banks are storing currency figures, they stor them as integers (usually in cents).
this is to avoid rounding errors.

*This program:*
 * *Prompts the user to read in 2 money amounts in cents.*
 * *Then adds the 2 amounts entered.*
 * *Then prints out the answer in a readable format with a euro sign and a decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount.*
 
***Note:*** the idea here is to break the task down into smaller parts as I am new to coding. Read in an integer first and print it back out, then read in the second integer and add the two. Then format the answer.

***user input:***
`enter amount1(in cents):65
`the amount is 65
`enter amount2(in cents):180
`the amount is 180

***the output is:***
`the sum of these is: â‚¬2.45
