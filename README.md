### Description
This readme file is related to the tasks outlined for the pands problem sheets for Programming and Scripting module in HDip in computing in Data Analytics.

The file here will explain the code, input and output for each task. It will also reference any sources used to solve and test the tasks.

Most of my problem solving for the tasks was gained throught practicing python coding in Andrew Beatty's lectures and weekley labs.

VSCode sofware is used to code the programs.


### Weekly Tasks

## *Hello World!*

Task 1 of the PANDS Problem Sheet was download and istall the software needed for the module. These were cmder (windows), anaconda, vscode, git and notepad++. After the required software was insatlled on my machine I created my github account and two repositories called ''mywork'' and ''pands-problem-sheet".

The pands-problem-sheet contains a python program that displays ***Hello World!*** when it is run. This is task 1.

***code***  
`print ("helloworld!")`

***user output:***  
`helloworld!`

## bank.py

This program is called bank.py. When banks are storing currency figures, they store them as integers (usually in cents).
this is to avoid rounding errors.

*This program:*
 * *Prompts the user to read in 2 money amounts in cents.*
 * *Then adds the 2 amounts entered.*
 * *Then prints out the answer in a readable format with a euro sign and a decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount.*
 
***Note:*** the idea here is to break the task down into smaller parts as I am new to coding. Read in the first amount and print it back out, then read in the second amount and add the two. Then format the answer.
The answer is formated so that the total amount has the euro sign and a decimal point.

The program uses calculation of the given code based on the users in put of 2 numbers.

***user calls:***  
`python bank.py`

***user input:***  
`enter amount1(in cents):65`

`enter amount2(in cents):180`


***output:***  
`the sum of these is: â‚¬2.45`

## accounts.py  

This program is called accounts.py.  

**The task was to:**
*Write a python program called accounts.py that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).*
*Extra: Modify the program to deal with account numbers of any length*  

Context: bank account numbers can be stored as 10 character strings, some applications only display the last 4 characters(digits) with the first 6 characters displayed as X's for security reasons.  

The 1st part of the program prompts the user to enter a 10 digit number. This is a string of 10 characters and not a 10 number string.
The *if* statement checks that exactly 10 digits are entered, if not the program outputs and ERROR message.
Then the *else* statement is used to print the account number with only the last 4 digits showing.  

Part 2: The program is modified to deal with user input of an acoount of any length.  

***user calls:***  
`python accounts.py`  

***user input 1:***  
`Please enter a 10-digit account number:0987654321` 

***output:***    
`Bank account number:  XXXXXX4321`  

***user input 2:***  
`please enter an account number(any length):112233`  

***output:***  
`bankaccnumber:  XXXXXX`

## collatz.py  

This program is called collatz.py.  
*It asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of a calculation in the program. At each step it calculates the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divides it by two, but if it is odd, multiplies it by three and add's one. The program ends if the current value is equal to one*
