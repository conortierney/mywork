### Description
This readme file is related to the tasks outlined for the pands problem sheets for Programming and Scripting module in HDip in computing in Data Analytics.

The file here will explain the code, input and output for each task. It will also reference any sources used to solve and test the tasks.

Most of my problem solving for the tasks was gained throught practicing python coding in Andrew Beatty's lectures and weekley labs.

VSCode sofware is used to code the programs.


### Weekly Tasks

## *Hello World!*

Task 1 of the PANDS Problem Sheet was download and istall the software needed for the module. These were cmder (windows), anaconda, vscode, git and notepad++. After the required software was insatlled on my machine I created my github account and two repositories called ''mywork'' and ''pands-problem-sheet".

The pands-problem-sheet contains a python program that displays ***Hello World!*** when it is run. This is task 1.

***code***  
`print ("helloworld!")`

***user output:***  
`helloworld!`

## bank.py

This program is called bank.py. When banks are storing currency figures, they store them as integers (usually in cents).
this is to avoid rounding errors.

*This program:*
 * *Prompts the user to read in 2 money amounts in cents.*
 * *Then adds the 2 amounts entered.*
 * *Then prints out the answer in a readable format with a euro sign and a decimal point between the euro and cent of the amount.*
 
***Note:*** the idea here is to break the task down into smaller parts as I am new to coding. Read in the first amount and print it back out, then read in the second amount and add the two. Then format the answer.
The answer is formated so that the total amount has the euro sign and a decimal point.

The program uses calculation of the given code based on the users in put of 2 numbers.

***user calls:***  
`python bank.py`

***user input:***  
`enter amount1(in cents):65`

`enter amount2(in cents):180`


***output:***  
`the sum of these is: â‚¬2.45`

## accounts.py  

This program is called accounts.py.  

**The task was to:**
*Write a python program called accounts.py that reads in a 10 character account number and outputs the account number with only the last 4 digits showing (and the first 6 digits replaced with Xs).*
*Extra: Modify the program to deal with account numbers of any length*  

Context: bank account numbers can be stored as 10 character strings, some applications only display the last 4 characters(digits) with the first 6 characters displayed as X's for security reasons.  

The 1st part of the program prompts the user to enter a 10 digit number. This is a string of 10 characters and not a 10 number string.
The *if* statement checks that exactly 10 digits are entered, if not the program outputs and ERROR message.
Then the *else* statement is used to print the account number with only the last 4 digits showing.  

Part 2: The program is modified to deal with user input of an acoount of any length.  

***user calls:***  
`python accounts.py`  

***user input 1:***  
`Please enter a 10-digit account number:0987654321` 

***output:***    
`Bank account number:  XXXXXX4321`  

***user input 2:***  
`please enter an account number(any length):112233`  

***output:***  
`bankaccnumber:  XXXXXX`

## collatz.py  

This program is called collatz.py.  
*It asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of a calculation in the program. At each step it calculates the next value by taking the current value and, if it is even, divides it by two, but if it is odd, multiplies it by three and add's one. The program ends if the current value is equal to one*


I added some code to handle negative numbers in the program. I did this using a while loop and an error message so that the user is prompted again to enter a POSITIVE number.

In the program, I check if a number is odd or even by using another *while* loop. The program keep doing this until it reaches the number 1.  
*If* and *else* statements are used.  
If the number is even, it's divided by 2 and print the result. If the number is odd, it's multiplied by 3 and add 1, and then print the result.  

***user calls:***  
`Please enter a positive number: 13`  

***output if positive number entered:***  
`13 40 20 10 5 16 8 4 2 1`  

***user calls:***  
`Please enter a positive number: -12`  

***output if negative number entered:***  
`-12 :isn't a positive number.`
`Enter a positive number:`

## weekday.py  

This program is called weekday.py  

*This program outputs whether or not today is a weekday*

The import function for date time is used (python built in functions).
***code***
`import datetime`  

Today is then defined if today is a weekday as an integer.  

***code***
`today = datetime.datetime.today().weekday()`  # where monday =0 and Sunday= 6.  

The *if* statement is used to check if today is a weekday. If it is not a weekday when the program is run the *else* statement is used to let the user know it is a weekend day. 
The program will have different ouptputs depending on the day the prorgan is run.













There it was found that by implementing date.weekday(), where Monday is 0 and Sunday is 6, it can easily be checked, with the help of if statement, whether today is weekday or weekend.

It's important to run the program on both the weekday and weekend to get a correct result.  

***user calls:***  
`python weekday.py`  

*this program does not requre any user input, it just outputs the result*  


***If its run on a weekday, the program output is:***  
`Oh no, today is a weekday, sorry!.`  

***If its run at the weekend, the program output is:***  
`Happy days, today is a weekend day.`
